Huntsman Inc. Elevator Pitch:

Howdy! My name is Marwan Elzarka and I am an emerging chemical Engineering from Texas A&M! I decided to pursue this major because I love chemistry!
It absolutely blows my mind how the world around us functions due to chemical processes that happen naturally! 
I'm very interested in chemical processes regarding polymer production and automation of those polymer producing plants. I have a background in computer science that enables me
to better automate such processes further to increase profit, efficiency, and further resolve the need stated by such processes. Huntsman is an international company that 
inspires those around it. I live in the woodlands and drove by your office everyday on my way to my internship at OnCenter software, where I built them a website and did 
some simulations with control theory! I would love to use my skills to help better your company, and push Huntsman to be the top of the industry for many years to come! Here is my
contact information, I look forward to hearing from you soon! Have a nice day!
